### **4. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
   This module provides a hands-on approach to building and deploying **RAG pipelines**. It covers how to design retrieval systems, integrate generative AI, and optimize for performance in real-world use cases. The module includes implementations for:
   - Managed RAG using OpenAI's services
   - DIY RAG with FAISS for local vector storage
   - LangChain RAG for framework-based development
   - PostgreSQL RAG for database-centric solutions
