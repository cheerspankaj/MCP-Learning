    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we build a foundational RAG system that:\n",
    "• **Retrieves** contextual information from scientific literature (e.g., PubMed abstracts)\n",

    "## **Motivation & Background** <a id=\"motivatio-&-background\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, though they still face significant limitations, especially in domain-specific or knowledge-intensive tasks. These limitations often manifest as **hallucinations** —answers that sound plausible but are factually incorrect—when handling queries beyond the model’s training data or requiring current information.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these challenges, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** incorporates external knowledge sources. By retrieving relevant document chunks through semantic similarity, RAG mitigates factual inaccuracies and keeps responses up to date. This integration ensures LLMs have the context they need to remain both accurate and current, fostering widespread adoption of RAG in real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Access to Fresh Information**  \n",
    "   LLMs rely on static training corpora, risking outdated responses. RAG taps into external, dynamic databases—providing the latest facts and cutting-edge data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Factual Grounding**  \n",
    "   LLMs excel at generating fluent text but can falter on factual correctness. By feeding retrieved text directly into the prompt, RAG reduces hallucinations and ensures evidence-based answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scalability & Efficiency**  \n",
    "   Even with long context windows, LLMs have token limits. RAG’s retrieval stage selectively brings in only the most relevant chunks, which saves costs and tokens while boosting relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Semantic Search & Re-Rankers**  \n",
    "   Modern RAG systems often leverage vector databases (for semantic search), possible keyword-based fallback, and re-rankers that ensure the top results are truly on-topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Quality & Reliability**  \n",
    "   By anchoring generated content to curated knowledge, RAG helps maintain consistency and accuracy. This is essential for domains like biotechnology, finance, or medicine, where mistakes can have serious consequences.\n",

    "## Motivation, Background & Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models (LLMs) have transformed our approach to text and information, yet they sometimes \"hallucinate\" when handling domain-specific or knowledge-intensive queries. This occurs because LLMs rely on static training data that doesn’t capture the latest, domain-specific nuances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** fixes this gap by integrating up-to-date external information. It retrieves relevant segments from a curated knowledge base and merges this context with the LLM's generative power to produce answers that are both fluent and factually grounded—essential for high-stakes fields like biotechnology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of a RAG System\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Preprocessing & Chunking:**  \n",
    "   Break long documents into manageable, semantically coherent chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Embedding Generation:**  \n",
    "   Convert chunks into numerical vectors using models (e.g., OpenAI’s embeddings).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Vector Database & Semantic Search:**  \n",
    "   Store embeddings to enable similarity-based retrieval of relevant text.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Prompt Augmentation:**  \n",
    "   Combine retrieved context with the original query to “ground” the LLM’s response.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Generative Answer Synthesis:**  \n",
    "   The LLM processes the augmented prompt to generate responses that are precise and domain-tailored.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Access to Fresh Information:**  \n",
    "  RAG taps into dynamic external databases, ensuring responses reflect current data rather than outdated training corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Factual Grounding:**  \n",
    "  By integrating real-world information directly into the prompt, RAG minimizes hallucinations and supports evidence-based answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient Context Management:**  \n",
    "  It selectively pulls in only the most relevant pieces—keeping token usage economical and responses focused.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Retrieval Performance:**  \n",
    "  Modern RAG systems utilize vector searches, keyword fallback, and re-ranking to ensure high-quality context is used for answer generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quality & Reliability for Critical Domains:**  \n",
    "  Anchoring outputs in curated external knowledge helps maintain consistency and trustworthiness—vital in fields such as biotechnology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supporting Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a visual outline of the RAG evolution—from naive to advanced and modular architectures—which frames our approach within the broader continuum:\n",
    "\n",
    "This diagram reinforces our message: as we move from basic DIY RAG toward a fully managed solution, we gain scalability and ease-of-use while still retaining the accuracy and reliability essential for scientific research.\n",

The role of MDA5 in sensing unedited cellular dsRNA and the downstream activation of type I interferon (IFN) signaling are well established. However, we have an incomplete understanding of pathways that modify the response to unedited dsRNA. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen and showed that GGNBP2, CNOT10, and CNOT11 interact and regulate sensing of unedited cellular dsRNA. We found that GGNBP2 acts between dsRNA transcription and its cytoplasmic sensing by MDA5. GGNBP2 loss prevented induction of type I IFN and autoinflammation after the loss of ADAR1 editing activity by modifying the subcellular distribution of endogenous A-to-I editing substrates and reducing cytoplasmic dsRNA load. These findings reveal previously undescribed pathways to modify diseases associated with ADAR mutations and may be determinants of response or resistance to small-molecule ADAR1 inhibitors.\",\n",
    "    \"New Abstract 2: T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM-3) is an important immune checkpoint molecule initially identified as a marker of IFN-γ–producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Since then, our understanding of its role in immune responses has significantly expanded. Here, we review emerging evidence demonstrating unexpected roles for TIM-3 as a key regulator of myeloid cell function, in addition to recent work establishing TIM-3 as a delineator of terminal T cell exhaustion, thereby positioning TIM-3 at the interface between fatigued immune responses and reinvigoration. We share our perspective on the antagonism between TIM-3 and T cell stemness, discussing both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic mechanisms underlying this relationship. Looking forward, we discuss approaches to decipher the underlying mechanisms by which TIM-3 regulates stemness, which has remarkable potential for the treatment of cancer, autoimmunity, and autoinflammation.\"\n",
