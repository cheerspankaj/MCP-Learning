    "In the above example, it would become tedious to continually update this prompt and paste it into ChatGPT (e.g. for patients at multiple trial sites or at various points in the trial) or to use a larger dataset. It would be easier and more scalable to use the OpenAI API to automate this process. \n",

    "- Automated Programmatic Workflows\n",
    "   - Enables automation of repetitive tasks, allowing you to run the same processes multiple times with different inputs efficiently (as well as batch processing!)\n",

    "   - Greater flexibility in choosing specific models, adjusting model parameters, and customizing system prompts\n",
    "- Production-Ready Capabilities\n",

    "Using file search in Responses API is a great precursor to understanding Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, a topic which will be covered in a later module. By integrating file search, you are storing information from files in a vector store which can then be used to dynamically retrieve relevant information and feed that context to the model. This approach allows the LLM to augment its responses with factual data stored externally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like with other RAG systems, you can fine-tune some parameters to optimize search precision and relevance. For example, you can customize the number of results retrieved from the vector store, and add metadata filtering to enhance the quality of retrieved content. To explore these concepts further check out the [OpenAI File Search Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-file-search#retrieval-customization)."

    "#### Finetuning\n",
    "Sometimes just passing a file or knowledge base to the model may not be sufficient, and in *some* of these cases fine-tuning can help. Fine-tuning is the process of adapting an existing model to perform better for a specific task by training it on a task-specific dataset. This process requires a large, well-structured dataset and usually a **significant amount of time, effort, and cost**. It is always recommended to first explore prompt engineering, integrating knowledge bases, and/or leveraging function calling to achieve desired results before considering fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common use cases where fine-tuning can improve results: \n",
    "- Handling many edge cases in specific ways\n",
    "- Setting the style, tone, format, or other qualatative aspects in ways that's hard to articulate in a prompt\n",
    "- Improving reliability at producing a desired output\n",
    "\n",
    "For some long-term projects using LLMs, fine-tuning can reduce cost and/or latency associated with repeatedly sending lengthy prompts. In these cases the upfront cost of fine-tuning and hosting a fine-tuned model can pay off over time. An increasingly common trend is to replace usage of larger LLMs (like gpt-4o) with a fine-tuned smaller model (like gpt-4o-mini) to achieve cost savings and maintain or improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to our medical coding example we can consider how companies often accumulate large datasets of historical coding decisions. These datasets often contain the most challenging cases for medical coding (e.g. where conditions are represented differently than in the dictionary and may contain abbreviations and/or specialized terminology). In this context, it might be useful to fine-tune a smaller model with the historical coding dataset to create a company-specific medical coding model that makes decisions similar to past coding decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because most of us are using LLMs for proof-of-concept and shorter-term projects, we won't cover the specifics of fine-tuning with the OpenAI API here, but refer to the [OpenAI fine-tuning docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning) to learn more."
