  " many lepidopteran insects are agricultural pests that affect stored grains , food and fiber crops . \n these insects have negative ecological and economic impacts since they lower crop yield , and pesticides are expensive and can have off - target effects on beneficial arthropods \n . a better understanding of lepidopteran immunity will aid in identifying new targets for the development of specific insect pest management compounds . \n a fundamental aspect of immunity , and therefore a logical target for control , is the induction of antimicrobial peptide ( amp ) expression . \n these peptides insert into and disrupt microbial membranes , thereby promoting pathogen clearance and insect survival . \n pathways leading to amp expression have been extensively studied in the dipteran drosophila melanogaster . however , diptera are an important group of pollinators and pest management strategies that target their immune systems is not recommended . \n recent advances have facilitated investigation of lepidopteran immunity , revealing both conserved and derived characteristics . \n although the general pathways leading to amp expression are conserved , specific components of these pathways , such as recognition proteins have diverged . in this review \n we highlight how such comparative immunology could aid in developing pest management strategies that are specific to agricultural insect pests .

  " objectiveit has been proposed that skeletal muscle insulin resistance arises from the accumulation of intramyocellular lipid metabolites that impede insulin signaling , including diacylglycerol and ceramide . \n we determined the role of de novo ceramide synthesis in mediating muscle insulin resistance.research design and methodsmice were subjected to 12 weeks of diet - induced obesity ( dio ) , and then treated for 4 weeks with myriocin , an inhibitor of serine palmitoyl transferase-1 ( spt1 ) , the rate - limiting enzyme of de novo ceramide synthesis.resultsafter 12 weeks of dio , c57bl/6 mice demonstrated a doubling in gastrocnemius ceramide content , which was completely reversed ( 141.5  15.8 vs. 94.6  10.2 nmol / g dry wt ) via treatment with myriocin , whereas hepatic ceramide content was unaffected by dio . \n interestingly , myriocin treatment did not alter the dio - associated increase in gastrocnemius diacyglycerol content , and the only correlation observed between lipid metabolite accumulation and glucose intolerance occurred with ceramide ( r = 0.61 ) . \n dio mice treated with myriocin showed a complete reversal of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance which was associated with enhanced insulin - stimulated akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3 phosphorylation . \n furthermore , myriocin treatment also decreased intramyocellular ceramide content and prevented insulin resistance development in db / db mice . finally , myriocin - treated dio mice displayed enhanced oxygen consumption rates ( 3,041  124 vs. 2,407  124 \n ml / kg / h ) versus their control counterparts.conclusionsour results demonstrate that the intramyocellular accumulation of ceramide correlates strongly with the development of insulin resistance , and suggests that inhibition of spt1 is a potentially promising target for the treatment of insulin resistance .

  " \n objectives . the purpose of this analytical study was to examine and critique the engineering foundations of \n commonly accepted biomechanical principles of mandible fracture repair . \n materials and methods . \n basic principles of static equilibrium were applied to intact and plated mandibles , but instead of the traditional lever forces , the mandibles were subjected to more realistic occlusal forces . \n results . \n these loading conditions produced stress distributions within the intact mandible that were very different and more complex than the customary lever - based gradient . \n the analyses also demonstrated the entirely different mechanical environments within intact and plated mandibles . \n conclusions . because the loading and geometry of the lever - idealized mandible is incomplete , the associated widely accepted bone stress distribution ( tension on top and compression on the bottom ) should not be assumed . \n furthermore , the stress gradients within the bone of an intact mandible should not be extrapolated to the mechanical environment within the plated regions of a fractured mandible .

  " a neural network model of biophysical neurons in the midbrain is presented to drive a muscle fiber oculomotor plant during horizontal monkey saccades . \n neural circuitry , including omnipause neuron , premotor excitatory and inhibitory burst neurons , long lead burst neuron , tonic neuron , interneuron , abducens nucleus , and oculomotor nucleus , is developed to examine saccade dynamics . \n the time - optimal control strategy by realization of agonist and antagonist controller models is investigated . in consequence , \n each agonist muscle fiber is stimulated by an agonist neuron , while an antagonist muscle fiber is unstimulated by a pause and step from the antagonist neuron . \n it is concluded that the neural network is constrained by a minimum duration of the agonist pulse and that the most dominant factor in determining the saccade magnitude is the number of active neurons for the small saccades . for the large saccades \n , however , the duration of agonist burst firing significantly affects the control of saccades . \n the proposed saccadic circuitry establishes a complete model of saccade generation since it not only includes the neural circuits at both the premotor and motor stages of the saccade generator , but also uses a time - optimal controller to yield the desired saccade magnitude .

  " diclofenac , a nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug , induces apoptosis on the neuroblastoma cell line sh - sy5y through a mitochondrial dysfunction , affecting some antioxidant mechanisms . \n indeed , the time- and dose - dependent increase of apoptosis is associated to an early enhancement of the reactive oxygen species ( ros ) . \n mitochondrial superoxide dismutase ( sod2 ) plays a crucial role in the defence against ros , thus protecting against several apoptotic stimuli . \n diclofenac decreased the protein levels and the enzymatic activity of sod2 , without any significant impairment of the corresponding mrna levels in the sh - sy5y extracts . \n when cells were incubated with an archaeal exogenous thioredoxin , an attenuation of the diclofenac - induced apoptosis was observed , together with an increase of sod2 protein levels . \n furthermore , diclofenac impaired the mitochondrial membrane potential , leading to a release of cytochrome c. these data suggest that mitochondria are involved in the diclofenac - induced apoptosis of sh - sy5y cells and point to a possible role of sod2 in this process .

  " amide hydrogen / deuterium exchange ( h / d exchange ) coupled with mass spectrometry has been widely used to analyze the interface of protein - protein interactions , protein conformational changes , protein dynamics and protein - ligand interactions . \n h / d exchange on the backbone amide positions has been utilized to measure the deuteration rates of the micro - regions in a protein by mass spectrometry1,2,3 . \n the resolution of this method depends on pepsin digestion of the deuterated protein of interest into peptides that normally range from 3 - 20 residues . \n although the resolution of h / d exchange measured by mass spectrometry is lower than the single residue resolution measured by the heteronuclear single quantum coherence ( hsqc ) method of nmr , the mass spectrometry measurement in h / d exchange is not restricted by the size of the protein4 . \n h / d exchange is carried out in an aqueous solution which maintains protein conformation . we provide a method that utilizes the maldi - tof for detection2 , instead of a hplc / esi ( electrospray ionization)-ms system5,6 . \n the maldi - tof provides accurate mass intensity data for the peptides of the digested protein , in this case protein kinase pak2 ( also called -pak ) . \n proteolysis of pak 2 is carried out in an offline pepsin digestion . \n this alternative method , when the user does not have access to a hplc and pepsin column connected to mass spectrometry , or when the pepsin column on hplc does not result in an optimal digestion map , for example , the heavily disulfide - bonded secreted phospholipase a2 ( spla2 ) . \n utilizing this method , we successfully monitored changes in the deuteration level during activation of pak2 by caspase 3 cleavage and autophosphorylation7,8,9 .

  " according to a patient - centered viewpoint , the meaning of harmonization in the context of laboratory medicine is that the information should be comparable irrespective of the measurement procedure used and where and/or when a measurement is made . \n harmonization represents a fundamental aspect of quality in laboratory medicine as its ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes through the provision of an accurate and actionable laboratory information . \n although the initial focus has to a large extent been to harmonize and standardize analytical processes and methods , the scope of harmonization goes beyond to include all other aspects of the total testing process ( ttp ) , such as terminology and units , report formats , reference intervals and decision limits , as well as tests and test profiles request and criteria for interpretation . \n two major progresses have been made in the area of harmonization in laboratory medicine : first , the awareness that harmonization should take into consideration not only the analytical phase but all steps of the ttp , thus dealing with the request , the sample , the measurement , and the report . \n second , as the processes required to achieve harmonization are complicated , a systematic approach is needed . \n the international federation of clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine ( ifcc ) has played a fundamental and successful role in the development of standardized and harmonized assays , and now it should continue to work in the field through the collaboration and cooperation with many other stakeholders .

  " ribonucleic acids ( rna ) are hypothesized to have preceded their derivatives , deoxyribonucleic acids ( dna ) , as the molecular media of genetic information when life emerged on earth . \n molecular biologists are accustomed to the dramatic effects a subtle variation in the ribose moiety composition between rna and dna can have on the stability of these molecules . while dna is very stable after extraction from biological samples and subsequent treatment , rna is notoriously labile . the short half - life property , inherent to rna , benefits cells that do not need to express their entire repertoire of proteins . \n the cellular machinery turns off the production of a given protein by shutting down the transcription of its cognate coding gene and by either actively degrading the remaining mrna or allowing it to decay on its own . \n the steady - state level of each mrna in a given cell varies continuously and is specified by changing kinetics of synthesis and degradation . because it is technically possible to simultaneously measure thousands of nucleic acid molecules , \n these quantities have been studied by the life sciences community to investigate a range of biological problems . \n since the rna abundance can change according to a wide range of perturbations , this makes it the molecule of choice for exploring biological systems ; its instability , on the other hand , could be an underestimated source of technical variability . we found that a large fraction of the rna abundance originally present in the biological system prior to extraction was masked by the rna labeling and measurement procedure . \n the method used to extract rna molecules from cells and to label them prior to hybridization operations on dna arrays affects the original distribution of rna . \n only if rna measurements are performed according to the same procedure can biological information be inferred from the assay read out .

  " backgroundabnormal lipid levels are considered one of the most significant risk factors for atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease , two of the main causes of death worldwide . \n apart from monogenic cases of hypercholesterolemia , most of the common dyslipidemias are caused by a number of low - impact polymorphisms . \n it has recently been reported that frequent polymorphisms at a large number of loci are significantly associated with one or more blood lipid parameters in many populations . \n identifying these associations in different populations and estimating the possible interactions between genetic models are necessary to explain the underlying genetic architecture of the associated loci and their ultimate impact on lipid - associated traits.methodswe estimated the association between 144 common single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) from published genome - wide association studies and the levels of total cholesterol , low- and high - density lipoprotein  cholesterol , and triglycerides in 1273 individuals from the genome database of the latvian population . \n we analyzed a panel of 144 common snps with illumina goldengate genotyping assays on the illumina beadxpress system.resultsten snps at the cetp locus and two at the mlxipl locus were associated with reduced high - density lipoprotein  \n cholesterol levels ; one snp at the tomm40 locus was associated with increased low - density lipoprotein  \n cholesterol ; and four snps at the mlxipl locus were associated with increased log triglyceride levels . \n there was also a significant correlation between the number of risk alleles and all the lipid parameters , suggesting that the coexistence of many low - impact snps has a greater effect on the dyslipidemia phenotype than the individual effects of found snps.conclusionwe conclude that the cetp , mlxipl , and tomm40 loci are the strongest genetic factors underlying the variability in lipid traits in our population .

  " in huntington 's disease and other polyglutamine ( polyq ) disorders , mutant proteins containing a long polyq stretch are well documented as the trigger of numerous aberrant cellular processes that primarily lead to degeneration and , ultimately , the death of neuronal cells . however , mutant transcripts containing expanded cag repeats may also be toxic and contribute to cellular dysfunction . \n the exact nature and importance of rna toxicity in polyq diseases are only beginning to be recognized , and the first insights have mainly resulted from studies using simple model systems . in this review , \n we briefly present the basic mechanisms of protein toxicity in polyq disorders and rna toxicity in myotonic dystrophy type 1 and discuss recent results suggesting that the pathogenesis of polyq diseases may also be mediated by mutant transcripts . \n this review is focused on the experimental systems used thus far to demonstrate rna toxicity in polyq disorders and the design of new systems that will be more relevant to the human disease situation and capable of separating rna toxicity from protein toxicity .

  " the premise of this paper is that increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases ( mmps ) permits the reconfiguration of synaptic connections ( i.e. , neural plasticity ) by degrading cell adhesion molecules ( cams ) designed to provide stability to those extracellular matrix ( ecm ) proteins that form scaffolding supporting neurons and glia . \n it is presumed that while these ecm proteins are weakened , and/or detached , synaptic connections can form resulting in new neural pathways . \n tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases ( timps ) are designed to deactivate mmps permitting the reestablishment of cams , thus returning the system to a reasonably fixed state . \n this review considers available findings concerning the roles of mmps and timps in reorganizing ecm proteins thus facilitating the neural plasticity underlying long - term potentiation ( ltp ) , habituation , and associative learning . \n we conclude with a consideration of the influence of these phenomena on drug addiction , given that these same processes may be instrumental in the formation of addiction and subsequent relapse \n . however , our knowledge concerning the precise spatial and temporal relationships among the mechanisms of neural plasticity , habituation , associative learning , and memory consolidation is far from complete and the possibility that these phenomena mediate drug addiction is a new direction of research .

  " body motion is a rich source of information for social cognition . however , gender effects in body language reading are largely unknown . here \n we investigated whether , and , if so , how recognition of emotional expressions revealed by body motion is gender dependent . \n to this end , females and males were presented with point - light displays portraying knocking at a door performed with different emotional expressions . \n the findings show that gender affects accuracy rather than speed of body language reading . \n this effect , however , is modulated by emotional content of actions : males surpass in recognition accuracy of happy actions , whereas females tend to excel in recognition of hostile angry knocking . \n advantage of women in recognition accuracy of neutral actions suggests that females are better tuned to the lack of emotional content in body actions . \n the study provides novel insights into understanding of gender effects in body language reading , and helps to shed light on gender vulnerability to neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental impairments in visual social cognition .

  " chloroquine , long the default first - line treatment against malaria , is now abandoned in large parts of the world because of widespread drug - resistance in plasmodium falciparum . in spite of its importance as a cost - effective and efficient drug , a coherent understanding of the cellular mechanisms affected by chloroquine and how they influence \n the fitness and survival of the parasite remains elusive . \n here , we used a systems biology approach to integrate genome - scale transcriptomics to map out the effects of chloroquine , identify targeted metabolic pathways , and translate these findings into mechanistic insights . specifically , we first developed a method that integrates transcriptomic and metabolomic data , which we independently validated against a recently published set of such data for krebs - cycle mutants of p.  falciparum . \n we then used the method to calculate the effect of chloroquine treatment on the metabolic flux profiles of p.  falciparum during the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle . \n the model predicted dose - dependent inhibition of dna replication , in agreement with earlier experimental results for both drug - sensitive and drug - resistant p.  falciparum strains . \n our simulations also corroborated experimental findings that suggest differences in chloroquine sensitivity between ring- and schizont - stage p.  falciparum . \n our analysis also suggests that metabolic fluxes that govern reduced thioredoxin and phosphoenolpyruvate synthesis are significantly decreased and are pivotal to chloroquine - based inhibition of p.  falciparum dna replication . \n the consequences of impaired phosphoenolpyruvate synthesis and redox metabolism are reduced carbon fixation and increased oxidative stress , respectively , both of which eventually facilitate killing of the parasite . \n our analysis suggests that a combination of chloroquine ( or an analogue ) and another drug , which inhibits carbon fixation and/or increases oxidative stress , should increase the clearance of p.  falciparum from the host system .

  " subdural arteriovenous fistula ( sdavf ) is a rare condition characterized by clinical manifestations ranging from mild bilateral sensory deficits to quadriplegia . \n the diagnosis is often delayed due to unspecific neurological symptoms , initially diagnosed as polyneuropathy or myelopathy . \n the diagnosis can be delayed for as long as 115 years . \n the following report describes a cervical sdavf case initially misdiagnosed as myelitis transversa and treated with intravenous steroids . a 56-year - old male presented with sensory deficits and mild leg and right arm weakness . \n cervical mri showed a central medullary hyperintense lesion with contrast enhancement . \n after metabolic , infectious , and malignant causes were excluded , myelitis transversa was presumed and the patient was treated intravenously with methylprednisolone . shortly after that , he developed quadriplegia . \n cervical mri imaging showed engorged cervical perimedullary vessels , which were not visible on the initial mri . \n the diagnosis was revised and a sdavf identified . \n prompt surgical treatment led to a complete recovery . \n the effect of intravenous steroids in sdavf is controversial . \n acute clinical worsening after steroid administration is previously reported in several publications ; however , due to the paucity of clinical studies on sdavf , this effect remains mostly overlooked or unknown . \n the findings in this patient support the causative relation between sdavf clinical worsening and steroid administration . \n we propose that acute clinical worsening under steroids in patients initially diagnosed with myelitis should raise suspicion of an sdavf .

  " recent studies revealed layers of enhanced aerosol scattering in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere over asia ( asian tropopause aerosol layer ( atal ) ) and north america ( north american tropospheric aerosol layer ( natal ) ) . \n we use a sectional aerosol model ( community aerosol and radiation model for atmospheres ( carma ) ) coupled with the community earth system model version 1 ( cesm1 ) to explore the composition and optical properties of these aerosol layers . \n the observed aerosol extinction enhancement is reproduced by cesm1/carma . \n both model and observations indicate a strong gradient of the sulfur - to - carbon ratio from europe to the asia on constant pressure surfaces . \n we found that the atal is mostly composed of sulfates , surface - emitted organics , and secondary organics ; the natal is mostly composed of sulfates and secondary organics . \n the model also suggests that emission increases in asia between 2000 and 2010 led to an increase of aerosol optical depth of the atal by 0.002 on average which is consistent with observations.key points \n the asian tropopause aerosol layer is composed of sulfate , primary organics , and secondary organics \n the north american tropospheric aerosol layer is mostly composed of sulfate and secondary organics \n aerosol optical depth of asian tropopause aerosol layer increases by 0.002 from 2000 to 2010 \n\n ",
  " background : in neutron interaction with matter and reduction of neutron energy due to multiple scatterings to the thermal energy range , increasing the probability of thermal neutron capture by neutron captures makes dose enhancement in the tumors loaded with these materials . \n \n objective : the purpose of this study is to evaluate dose distribution in the presence of 10b , 157gd and 33s neutron capturers and to determine the effect of these materials on dose enhancement rate for 252cf brachytherapy source . \n \n methods : neutron - ray flux and energy spectra , neutron and gamma dose rates and dose enhancement factor ( def ) are determined in the absence and presence of 10b , 157gd and 33s using monte carlo simulation . \n \n results : the difference in the thermal neutron flux rate in the presence of 10b and 157gd is significant , while the flux changes in the fast and epithermal energy ranges are insensible . \n the dose enhancement factor has increased with increasing distance from the source and reached its maximum amount equal to 258.3 and 476.1 cgy / h/g for 157gd and 10b , \n respectively at about 8 cm distance from the source center . \n def for 33s is equal to one . \n \n conclusion : results show that the magnitude of dose augmentation in tumors containing 10b and 157gd in brachytherapy with 252cf source will depend not only on the capture product dose level , \n but also on the tumor distance from the source . \n 33s makes dose enhancement under specific conditions that these conditions depend on the neutron energy spectra of source , the 33s concentration \n in tumor and tumor distance from the source . \n ",
  " foldback intercoil ( fbi ) dna is formed by the folding back at one point of a non - helical parallel track of double - stranded dna at as sharp as 180 and the intertwining of two double helixes within each other 's major groove to form an intercoil with a diameter of 2.2 nm . fbi dna has been suggested to mediate intra - molecular homologous recombination of a deletion and inversion . inter - molecular homologous recombination , known as site - specific insertion , on the other hand , is mediated by the direct perpendicular approach of the fbi dna tip , as the attp site , onto the target dna , as the attb site . \n transposition of dna transposons involves the pairing of terminal inverted repeats and 5 - 7-bp tandem target duplication . \n fbi dna configuration effectively explains simple as well as replicative transposition , along with the involvement of an enhancer element . \n the majority of diverse retrotransposable elements that employ a target site duplication mechanism is also suggested to follow the fbi dna - mediated perpendicular insertion of the paired intercoil ends by non - homologous end - joining , together with gap filling . a genome - wide perspective of transposable elements in light of fbi dna is discussed .

  " cigarette smoking is highly correlated with the onset of a variety of human cancers , and continued smoking is known to abrogate the beneficial effects of cancer therapy . while tobacco smoke contains hundreds of molecules that are known carcinogens , nicotine , the main addictive component of tobacco smoke , is not carcinogenic . at the same time , nicotine has been shown to promote cell proliferation , angiogenesis , and epithelial - mesenchymal transition , leading to enhanced tumor growth and metastasis . \n these effects of nicotine are mediated through the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that are expressed on a variety of neuronal and nonneuronal cells . \n specific signal transduction cascades that emanate from different nachr subunits or subunit combinations facilitate the proliferative and prosurvival functions of nicotine . \n nicotinic acetylcholine receptors appear to stimulate many downstream signaling cascades induced by growth factors and mitogens . \n it has been suggested that antagonists of nachr signaling might have antitumor effects and might open new avenues for combating tobacco - related cancer . \n this paper examines the historical data connecting nicotine tumor progression and the recent efforts to target the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to combat cancer .

  " stress  especially chronic , uncontrollable stress  is an important risk factor for many neuropsychiatric disorders . \n the underlying mechanisms are complex and multifactorial , but they involve correlated changes in structural and functional measures of neuronal connectivity within cortical microcircuits and across neuroanatomically distributed brain networks . here , we review evidence from animal models and human neuroimaging studies implicating stress - associated changes in functional connectivity in the pathogenesis of ptsd , depression , and other neuropsychiatric conditions . \n changes in fmri measures of corticocortical connectivity across distributed networks may be caused by specific structural alterations that have been observed in the prefrontal cortex , hippocampus , and other vulnerable brain regions . \n these effects are mediated in part by glucocorticoids , which are released from the adrenal gland in response to a stressor and also oscillate in synchrony with diurnal rhythms . \n recent work indicates that circadian glucocorticoid oscillations act to balance synapse formation and pruning after learning and during development , and chronic stress disrupts this balance . \n we conclude by considering how disrupted glucocorticoid oscillations may contribute to the pathophysiology of depression and ptsd in vulnerable individuals , and how circadian rhythm disturbances may affect non - psychiatric populations , including frequent travelers , shift workers , and patients undergoing treatment for autoimmune disorders .

  " due to their unique structural and functional properties , subplate cells are ideally suited to function as important amplifying units within the developing neocortical circuit . \n subplate neurons have extensive dendritic and axonal ramifications and relatively mature functional properties , i.e. their action potential firing can exceed frequencies of 40 hz . at earliest stages of corticogenesis subplate cells \n receive functional synaptic inputs from the thalamus and from other cortical and non - cortical sources . \n glutamatergic and depolarizing gabaergic inputs arise from cortical neurons and neuromodulatory inputs arise from the basal forebrain and other sources . \n activation of postsynaptic metabotropic receptors , i.e. muscarinic receptors , elicits in subplate neurons oscillatory burst discharges which are transmitted via electrical and chemical synapses to neighbouring subplate cells and to immature neurons in the cortical plate . \n the tonic non - synaptic release of gaba from gabaergic subplate cells facilitates the generation of burst discharges . \n these cellular bursts are amplified by prominent gap junction coupling in the subplate and cortical plate , thereby eliciting 1020 hz oscillations in a local columnar network . \n thus , we propose that neuronal networks are organized at earliest stages in a gap junction coupled columnar syncytium . \n we postulate that the subplate does not only serve as a transient relay station for afferent inputs , but rather as an active element amplifying the afferent and intracortical activity .

  " anabolic androgenic steroids ( aass ) represent a large group of synthetic derivatives of testosterone , produced to maximize anabolic effects and minimize the androgenic ones . \n aas can be administered orally , parenterally by intramuscular injection and transdermally . \n androgens act by binding to the nuclear androgen receptor ( ar ) in the cytoplasm and then translocate into the nucleus . \n this binding results in sequential conformational changes of the receptor affecting the interaction between receptor and protein , and receptor and dna.skeletal muscle can be considered as the main target tissue for the anabolic effects of aas , which are mediated by ars which after exposure to aass are up - regulated and their number increases with body building . \n therefore , aass determine an increase in muscle size as a consequence of a dose - dependent hypertrophy resulting in an increase of the cross - sectional areas of both type i and type ii muscle fibers and myonuclear domains . \n moreover , it has been reported that aass can increase tolerance to exercise by making the muscles more capable to overload therefore shielding them from muscle fiber damage and improving the level of protein synthesis during recovery.despite some therapeutic use of aass , there is also wide abuse among athletes especially bodybuilders in order to improve their performances and to increase muscle growth and lean body mass , taking into account the significant anabolic effects of these drugs.the prolonged misuse and abuse of aass can determine several adverse effects , some of which may be even fatal especially on the cardiovascular system because they may increase the risk of sudden cardiac death ( scd ) , myocardial infarction , altered serum lipoproteins , and cardiac hypertrophy . \n the aim of this review is to focus on deaths related to aas abuse , trying to evaluate the autoptic , histopathological and toxicological findings in order to investigate the pathophysiological mechanism that underlines this type of death , which is still obscure in several aspects . \n the review of the literature allowed us to identify 19 fatal cases between 1990 and 2012 , in which the autopsy excluded in all cases , extracardiac causes of death .

  "  bottom up proteomic studies typically use tandem mass spectrometry data to infer peptide ion sequence , enabling identification of the protein whence they derive . \n the majority of such studies employ collision - induced dissociation ( cid ) to induce fragmentation of the peptide structure giving diagnostic b- , y- , and a- ions . \n recently , rearrangement processes that result in scrambling of the original peptide sequence during cid have been reported for these ions . \n such processes have the potential to adversely affect ion accounting ( and thus scores from automated search algorithms ) in tandem mass spectra , and in extreme cases could lead to false peptide identification . here , \n analysis of peptide species produced by lys - n proteolysis of standard proteins is performed and sequences that exhibit such rearrangement processes identified . \n the effect of increasing the gas - phase basicity of the n - terminal lysine residue through derivatization to homoarginine toward such sequence scrambling is then assessed . \n the presence of a highly basic homoarginine ( or arginine ) residue at the n - terminus is found to disfavor / inhibit sequence scrambling with a coincident increase in the formation of b(n-1)+h2o product ions . finally , further analysis of a sequence produced by lys - c proteolysis provides evidence toward a potential mechanism for the apparent inhibition of sequence scrambling during resonance excitation cid.graphical abstract ",
  " the diagnosis of juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ( jncl ) is usually based on age of onset , initial clinical symptoms , clinical progression , and pathologic findings . \n our cases manifested atypical clinical symptomatology and/or pathologic findings and therefore , represent variant forms of jncl . \n case 1 and 2 presented with slow developmental regression from the age of 4 years and became blind and wheelchair bound at around 8 years . \n pathologic finding of lymphocytes showed fingerprint inclusion which was consistent with jncl . \n mutational analysis was positive for cln5 which usually presents as variant late infantile ncl ( lincl ) and more common in finnish population . \n case 3 presented with progressive visual loss from the age of 8 years . clinical symptomatology and age of onset were similar to that of jncl but was found to have low palmitoyl protein thioesterase , granular inclusion body , and cln1 mutation , thus representing milder form of incl . \n these three cases demonstrated phenotypic - genotypic variations . \n pertinent issues relating diagnostic difficulties , ophthalmologic , neuroradiological , and laboratory aspects are discussed .

  " chemical analysis of the sri lankan tea ( camellia sinensis , l. ) germplasm would immensely contribute to the success of the tea breeding programme . \n however , the polyphenols , particularly catechins ( flavan-3-ols ) , are readily prone to oxidation in the conventional method of sample preparation . \n therefore , optimization of the present sample preparation methodology for the profiling of metabolites is much important . \n two sample preparation methodologies were compared , fresh leaves ( as in the conventional procedures ) and freeze - dried leaves ( a new procedure ) , for quantification of major metabolites by employing two cultivars , one is known to be high quality black tea and the other low quality black tea . \n the amounts of major metabolites such as catechins , caffeine , gallic acid , and theobromine , recorded in the new sampling procedure via freeze - dried leaves , were significantly higher than those recorded in the conventional sample preparation procedure . \n additionally new method required less amount of leaf sample for analysis of major metabolites and facilitates storage of samples until analysis . \n the freeze - dried method would be useful for high throughput analysis of large number of samples in shorter period without chemical deterioration starting from the point of harvest until usage . \n hence , this method is more suitable for metabolite profiling of tea as well as other phenol rich plants .

  " skin - lightening is an aesthetic practice of global concern . by adopting a biopsycho - social approach \n , we consider the interplay between the biological , psychological and social factors that underpin the circulation and consumption of skin lighteners in south africa . \n this paper reflects on biological aspects of skin lightening , interpersonal relationships , individual beliefs and expectations about the maintenance of health and well being that informs cosmetic practices . \n the paper seeks to examine claims made by historians ( thomas ) and political philosophers and activists ( biko ) that colonialism and apartheid in south africa historically reinforced the use of skin lightening products in the country . \n the paper also investigates the role of media in staking out the boundaries of beauty . \n we argue that men and women practice skin - lightening not only as a complex result of the internalization of global standards of beauty , but meshed with a national politics of race and colorism . banning skin lightening products without understanding the biological effects but also the social forces that underlie their increased popularity will prove futile . \n moreover , we must consider the immeasurable pleasures associated with lightening , and the feelings with achieving visibility in south africa , a country that continues to wrestle with blackness .

  " summarychronic rejection of solid organ allografts remains the major cause of transplant failure . \n donor - derived tissue - resident lymphocytes are transferred to the recipient during transplantation , but their impact on alloimmunity is unknown . using mouse cardiac transplant models , \n we show that graft - versus - host recognition by passenger donor cd4 t  cells markedly augments recipient cellular and humoral alloimmunity , resulting in more severe allograft vasculopathy and early graft failure . \n this augmentation is enhanced when donors were pre - sensitized to the recipient , is dependent upon avoidance of host nk cell recognition , and is partly due to provision of cognate help for allo - specific b cells from donor cd4 t  cells recognizing b cell mhc class ii in a peptide - degenerate manner . \n passenger donor lymphocytes may therefore influence recipient alloimmune responses and represent a therapeutic target in solid organ transplantation .

  " objectivepancreas organogenesis is orchestrated by interactions between the epithelium and the mesenchyme , but these interactions are not completely understood . \n here we investigated a role for bone morphogenetic protein ( bmp ) signaling within the pancreas mesenchyme and found it to be required for the normal development of the mesenchyme as well as for the pancreatic epithelium.research design and methodswe analyzed active bmp signaling by immunostaining for phospho - smad1,5,8 and tested whether pancreas development was affected by bmp inhibition after expression of noggin and dominant negative bmp receptors in chicken and mouse pancreas.resultsendogenous bmp signaling is confined to the mesenchyme in the early pancreas and inhibition of bmp signaling results in severe pancreatic hypoplasia with reduced epithelial branching . \n notably , we also observed an excessive endocrine differentiation when mesenchymal bmp signaling is blocked , presumably secondary to defective mesenchyme to epithelium signaling.conclusionswe conclude that bmp signaling plays a previously unsuspected role in the mesenchyme , required for normal development of the mesenchyme as well as for the epithelium .

  " increasing research has evidenced that our brain retains a capacity to change in response to experience until late adulthood . \n this implies that cognitive training can possibly ameliorate age - associated cognitive decline by inducing training - specific neural plastic changes at both neural and behavioral levels . \n this longitudinal study examined the behavioral effects of a systematic thirteen - week cognitive training program on attention and working memory of older adults who were at risk of cognitive decline . \n these older adults were randomly assigned to the cognitive training group ( n = 109 ) and the active control group ( n = 100 ) . findings clearly indicated that training induced improvement in auditory and visual - spatial attention and working memory . \n the training effect was specific to the experience provided because no significant difference in verbal and visual - spatial memory between the two groups was observed . \n this pattern of findings is consistent with the prediction and the principle of experience - dependent neuroplasticity . \n findings of our study provided further support to the notion that the neural plastic potential continues until older age . the baseline cognitive status did not correlate with pre- versus posttraining changes to any cognitive variables studied , suggesting that the initial cognitive status may not limit the neuroplastic potential of the brain at an old age .

  " acute liver failure ( alf ) can be the consequence of various etiologies , that might vary between different geographic regions . \n most frequent are intoxications with acetaminophen , viral hepatitis , or liver damage of unknown origin . \n alf occurs when the extent of hepatocyte death exceeds the regenerative capacity of the liver . \n the mode of liver cell death that is predominantly induced in alf , i.e. , apoptosis or necrosis , is still controversial and presumably determined by the etiology , duration , and magnitude of liver injury . \n severe liver damage involves oxidative stress and depletion of atp resulting in necrosis . in contrast , maintenance of atp stores is required for the execution of apoptosis . \n recent data suggest that necrosis resulting from severe liver damage is associated with poor outcome of alf patients . \n discrimination between apoptosis and necrosis might be therefore useful for the identification of alf patients requiring liver transplantation . \n identification of the molecular cell death mechanisms remains an important issue not only for early prediction of alf outcome , but also for therapeutic interventions . in view of the pleiotropic functions of critical mediators of cell death and tissue regeneration , \n a particular challenge will be to reduce hepatocellular death without inhibiting the regenerative capacity of the liver . here , we review the molecular mechanisms of hepatocyte injury and the pathways leading to apoptosis and necrosis , which might represent potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets in alf .

  " the present case shows that a normal brachial blood pressure ( bp ) does not exclude severe coarctation and should be considered in normotensive patients presenting with a systolic murmur and/or unexplained severe left ventricular hypertrophy . \n congenital coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the descending aorta , usually located distal to the origin of the subclavian artery , causing hypertension in the upper part of the body . \n this condition may be undiagnosed until adult life where the clinical presentation most often is high bp in the upper extremities . a 57-year - old patient with severe aortic coarctation and left ventricular hypertrophy presented with normal brachial bp . \n however , standard suprasternal view by echocardiography indicated coarctation . \n multislice computed tomographic ( ct ) angiography revealed an uncommon location of the aortic narrowing with the right and left subclavian arteries originating below the area of coarctation , explaining the equally low bp in both upper extremities .

  " micrornas ( mirnas ) are small non - coding rnas ( 22 nucleotides ) regulating gene expression at the post - transcriptional level . by directing the rna - induced silencing complex ( risc ) to bind specific target mrnas \n , mirna can repress target genes and affect various biological phenotypes . \n functional mirna target recognition is known to majorly attribute specificity to consecutive pairing with seed region ( position 28 ) of mirna . \n recent advances in a transcriptome - wide method of mapping mirna binding sites ( ago hits - clip ) elucidated that a large portion of mirna - target interactions in vivo are mediated not only through the canonical  seed sites  but also via non - canonical sites ( 1580% ) , setting the stage to expand and determine their properties . here \n we focus on recent findings from transcriptome - wide non - canonical mirna - target interactions , specifically regarding  nucleation bulges  and  seed - like motifs  . \n we also discuss insights from ago hits - clip data alongside structural and biochemical studies , which highlight putative mechanisms of mirna target recognition , and the biological significance of these non - canonical sites mediating marginal repression .

  " the heterotrimeric g protein transducin is a key component of the \n  vertebrate phototransduction cascade . \n transducin is peripherally attached to \n  membranes of the rod outer segment , where it interacts with other proteins at \n  the membrane - cytosol interface . however , upon sustained activation by light , \n  the dissociated gt and \n  g11 subunits of transducin translocate from \n  the outer segment to other parts of the rod cell . \n here we used a computational \n  approach to analyze the interaction strength of transducin and its subunits \n  with acidic lipid bilayers , as well as the range of orientations that they are \n  allowed to occupy on the membrane surface . \n our results suggest that the \n  combined constraints of electrostatics and lipid anchors substantially limit \n  the rotational degrees of freedom of the membrane - bound transducin \n  heterotrimer . \n this may contribute to a faster transducin activation rate by \n  accelerating transducin - rhodopsin complex formation . \n notably , the membrane \n  interactions of the dissociated transducin subunits are very different from \n  those of the heterotrimer . as shown previously , \n  g11 experiences significant attractive \n  interactions with negatively charged membranes , whereas our new results \n  suggest that gt is electrostatically repelled by such \n  membranes . \n we suggest that this repulsion could facilitate the membrane \n  dissociation and intracellular translocation of gt. \n  moreover , based on similarities in sequence and electrostatic properties , we \n  propose that the properties described for transducin are common to its \n  homologs within the gi subfamily . in a broader view , this work \n  exemplifies how the activity - dependent association and dissociation of a g \n  protein can change both the affinity for membranes and the range of allowed \n  orientations , thereby modulating g protein function .

  " restoring posterior teeth with resin - based composite materials continues to gain popularity among \n clinicians , and the demand for such aesthetic restorations is increasing . indeed , the most common \n aesthetic alternative to dental amalgam is resin composite . \n moderate to large posterior composite \n restorations , however , have higher failure rates , more recurrent caries , and increased frequency of \n replacement . \n investigators across the globe are researching new materials and techniques that will \n improve the clinical performance , handling characteristics , and mechanical and physical properties \n of composite resin restorative materials . despite such attention , large to moderate posterior \n composite restorations continue to have a clinical lifetime that is approximately one - half that of \n the dental amalgam . \n while there are numerous recommendations regarding preparation design , \n restoration placement , and polymerization technique , current research indicates that restoration \n longevity depends on several variables that may be difficult for the dentist to control . \n these \n variables include the patient s caries risk , tooth position , patient habits , number of \n restored surfaces , the quality of the tooth  restoration bond , and the ability of the \n restorative material to produce a sealed tooth  restoration interface . \n although clinicians \n tend to focus on tooth form when evaluating the success and failure of posterior composite \n restorations , the emphasis must remain on advancing our understanding of the clinical variables that \n impact the formation of a durable seal at the restoration  tooth interface . \n this paper \n presents an update of existing technology and underscores the mechanisms that negatively impact the \n durability of posterior composite restorations in permanent teeth .

  " electrophysiological signals such as the eeg , meg , or lfps have been extensively studied over the last decades , and elaborate signal processing algorithms have been developed for their analysis . \n many of these methods are based on time - frequency decomposition to account for the signals ' spectral properties while maintaining their temporal dynamics . \n however , the data typically exhibit intra- and interindividual variability . \n existing algorithms often do not take into account this variability , for instance by using fixed frequency bands . \n this shortcoming has inspired us to develop a new robust and flexible method for time - frequency analysis and signal feature extraction using the novel smooth natural gaussian extension ( snage ) model . \n the model is nonlinear , and its parameters are interpretable . \n we propose an algorithm to derive initial parameters based on dynamic programming for nonlinear fitting and describe an iterative refinement scheme to robustly fit high - order models . \n we further present distance functions to be able to compare different instances of our model . \n the method 's functionality and robustness are demonstrated using simulated as well as real data . \n the snage model is a general tool allowing for a wide range of applications in biomedical data analysis .

  " asbestos and silica are well - known fibrogenic dusts . however , there is no comprehensive understanding of the molecular and cellular events that lead to fibrosis as a consequence of asbestos or silica inhalation . \n previous studies have shown that asbestos stimulates superoxide anion production in alveolar macrophages through the phospholipase c / protein kinase c pathway . \n in contrast , silica does not appear to activate this pathway nor stimulate superoxide anion production , but silica does stimulate cytokine release by some undetermined pathway . \n therefore , using human alveolar macrophages isolated from normal healthy volunteers , we evaluated the potential involvement of intracellular calcium and tyrosine kinases as potential signal transduction pathways . in the absence of serum , crystalline silica , and to a lesser extent amorphous silica , caused a rapid and dose - dependent elevation of intracellular calcium coming from the extracellular space . \n however , in the presence of serum , which is required for silica - stimulated cytokine release , neither form of silica caused noticeable elevation of intracellular calcium . \n silica , however , did increase the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation , most notably of proteins at approximately 46 and 50 kda , suggesting activation of a tyrosine kinase pathway . \n preincubation of alveolar macrophages for 24 hr with silica - primed human alveolar macrophages for enhanced interleukin-1 beta ( il-1 beta ) release stimulated by endotoxin ( lps ) that was dose dependent . the enhanced lps - stimulated release of il-1 beta correlated with enhanced mitogen - activated protein kinase activity . taken together , \n these results indicate that a tyrosine kinase pathway is activated during silica stimulation of human alveolar macrophages.imagesfigure 4 . \n afigure 4 . \n b ",

  " backgroundfibroblast growth factor 21 ( fgf21 ) belongs to the large family of fibroblast growth factors ( fgfs ) . \n even though fgf signaling has been mainly implicated in developmental processes , recent studies have demonstrated that fgf21 is an important regulator of whole body energy expenditure and metabolism , in obesity.scope of reviewgiven the fact that obesity has developed epidemic proportions , not just in industrialized countries , fgf21 has emerged as a novel therapeutic avenue to treat obesity as well as associated metabolic disorders . while the metabolic effects of fgf21 are undisputed , the mechanisms by which fgf21 regulate weight loss have not yet been fully resolved . until recently it was believed that fgf21 induces brown fat activity , thereby enhancing energy expenditure , which concomitantly leads to weight loss . \n novel studies have challenged this concept as they could demonstrate that a part of the fgf21 mediated effects are retained in a mouse model of impaired brown adipose tissue function.major conclusionsthe review illustrates the recent advances in fgf21 research and discusses the role of fgf21 in the regulation of energy expenditure linked to brown fat activity .

  " background : anterior rectal resection is sometimes necessary to treat deeply infiltrating rectovaginal endometriosis . we describe a completely laparoscopic approach as a new way of excising rectal endometriosis that can be used without opening any part of the rectum . \n this avoids opening the abdomen or any risk of fecal spillage.methods:the patient received preoperative oral bowel preparation . \n ureteric stents ( 6 f ) were inserted cystoscopically . \n the peritoneum in the ovarian fossae was opened lateral to any disease and the rectum reflected off the back of the cervix , leaving any endometriosis on the front of the rectum . \n the pelvic peritoneum was reflected medially , below the level of the ureters . \n the mesorectum was then dissected off a 6-cm length of rectum by using a harmonic scalpel . \n a circular end - to - end anastomosis instrument was passed anally until the outline of the anvil was visible , inside the colon , above the diseased rectum . \n the anvil was detached and held by a soft grasper before the rectum was then divided above and below the disease using a laparoscopic stapling device . \n the tip of the anvil was pushed through the proximal end of the colon allowing reanastomosis of the rectal stump.conclusion:the patient was discharged after 5 days without complications .

  " voice biometrics has a long history in biosecurity applications such as verification and identification based on characteristics of the human voice . \n the other application called voice classification which has its important role in grouping unlabelled voice samples , however , has not been widely studied in research . lately \n voice classification is found useful in phone monitoring , classifying speakers ' gender , ethnicity and emotion states , and so forth . in this paper , a collection of computational algorithms \n are proposed to support voice classification ; the algorithms are a combination of hierarchical clustering , dynamic time wrap transform , discrete wavelet transform , and decision tree . \n the proposed algorithms are relatively more transparent and interpretable than the existing ones , though many techniques such as artificial neural networks , support vector machine , and hidden markov model ( which inherently function like a black box ) have been applied for voice verification and voice identification . \n two datasets , one that is generated synthetically and the other one empirically collected from past voice recognition experiment , are used to verify and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed voice classification algorithm .

  " the current clinical use of psychotropic drugs is transnosologically oriented . \n this is facilitated by the current classification of mental disorders ( international classification of diseases , 10th revision [ icd-10 ] ) and is perhaps justified if depression and psychosis ( taken here as examples ) are considered as being complex syndromes with heterogeneous etiologies , but common pathogenesis , more than specific entities . \n however , this approach does not identify possible differences between specific psychiatric entities , which could in turn mask differences in therapeutic responses and , therefore , therapeutic outcome . \n this is compounded by the current disharmony between the nosological classification of diseases , drug development , clinical research , and therapeutic uses of psychotropic drugs . \n functional pharmacology targeting abnormal behavioral traits could represent an avenue for future research and treatment .

  " parkinson 's disease ( pd ) is a neurodegenerative condition which causes a characteristic movement disorder secondary to loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substanitia nigra . \n the motor disorder responds well to dopamine - replacement therapies , though these result in significant adverse effects due to non - physiological release of dopamine in the striatum , and off - target effects . \n cell - based regenerative treatments offer a potential means for targeted replacement of dopamine , in a physiological manner . \n dopaminergic neurons for cell - based therapies can be obtained from several sources . \n fetal ventral mesencephalon tissue contains dopaminergic neuron progenitors , and has been transplanted into the striatum of pd patients with good results in a number of cases . \n however , the ethical implications and logistical challenges of using fetal tissue mean that fetal ventral mesencephalon is unlikely to be used in a widespread clinical setting . \n induced pluripotent stem cells can be used to generate dopaminergic neurons for transplantation , providing a source of autologous tissue for grafting . \n this approach means that challenges associated with allografts , such as the potential for immune rejection , can be circumvented . \n however , the associated cost and difficulty in producing a standardized product from different cell lines means that , at present , this approach is not commercially viable as a cell - based therapy . \n dopaminergic neurons derived from embryonic stem cells offer the most promising basis for a cell - based therapy for parkinson 's disease , with trials due to commence in the next few years . \n though there are ethical considerations to take into account when using embryonic tissue , the possibility of producing a standardized , optimized cell product means that this approach can be both effective , and commercially viable .
